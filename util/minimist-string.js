     * because just doing a simple .split(' ') won't work with the following sentence:
     *
     * The argv would look like this:
     * foo -b "this is a string"

     * piece into a "good_pieces" array. However, if we detect that a piece is part of a string, we
     * concatenate it to the last element of "good_pieces" instead of creating a new element.
